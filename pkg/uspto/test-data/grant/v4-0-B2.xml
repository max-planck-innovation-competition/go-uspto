<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This invention pertains to water resistant coverings.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">More particularly, the invention pertains to a water resistant covering which is installed on an arm, leg, or other extremity or part of the body to cover a cast or otherwise protect the body and to prevent water from penetrating the covering.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">In a further respect, the invention pertains to a method for enabling an individual to use only a single hand to conveniently put a water resistant covering on an arm or leg.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Water resistant coverings for the arm or leg are well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,047,403 to Juozaitis, U.S. Pat. No. 5,761,746 to Brown, U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,286 to Kelly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,121 to Lahaussois et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,052 to Meehan, D406,897 to Agati et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,768,501 to George, U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,038 to Orange et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,919 to Silverberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,265 to Caponi, U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,712 to Joy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,523,586 to Couri, U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,713 to Hutchison, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,865,772 to George.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Conventional water resistant coverings are fastened or mounted on the arm or other extremity of an individual using elastic straps, VELCRO(TM) hook and loop fasteners, and other fastening means. Such prior art fastening systems, while functioning to maintain the covering in place on the user's extremity, appear to suffer from certain disadvantages. First, some fastening systems tend to restrict blood circulation in and movement of the user's extremity. Second, other fastening systems are not readily quickly removed from the user's extremity. Third, still other prior art systems are not readily installed without the help of a second individual. Fourth, yet other prior art systems are comfortable to wear but are not adjustable to insure that they efficiently seal and prevent water from seeping under the water resistant covering.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide an improved water resistant covering which could be readily installed and removed, which would be comfortable to wear and still prevent water from seeping into the covering, and which would not unnecessarily restrict movement of or blood flow in a user's body.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Therefore, it is a principal object of the instant invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for installing and using a water resistant covering on a part of the body.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Another object of the invention is to provide an improved water resistant covering which can with the use of only a single hand be installed on, removed from, and adjusted on a user's body.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">A further object of the invention is to provide a water resistant covering which includes a sealing mechanism that is readily adjusted, efficiently seals, and expands and contracts with tissues in a user's body during movement of the body.</p>

<p id="P-00029" num="00029">In a further embodiment of the invention, improvements are provided in combination with a water-resistant sleeve shaped and dimensioned to fit over a portion of the body of a user. The sleeve has a distal end and a proximate end. The portion of the user's body includes tissue which expands and contracts during movement of the extremity. The improvements enable the proximate end of the sleeve to be sealingly secured around with a single hand to the portion of the user's body such that the proximate end when sealingly secured expands and contract simultaneously with expansion and contraction of the portion of the user's body during movement of the portion of the user's body. The improvements include a pliable hem connected to the proximate end of the sleeve and foldable when drawn closed to fit sealingly around the portion of the user's body; an elongate, elastic strip extending through the hem to draw closed sealingly the hem against the portion of the user's body, the elastic strip elastically contracting and tapering when stretched; and, a releasable engagement system operable with a single hand to permit the strip to be stretched, tapered and drawn through the engagement system, to slide the engagement system along the strip to a position adjacent the portion of the user's body, to lock a portion of the stretched, tapered strip in the engagement system to prevent the strip from sliding through the engagement system, and to release the stretched strip to bunch against the engagement system to interfere with slidable passage of the strip through the engagement system.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">In still another embodiment of the invention, an improved method is provided for producing a water-resistant unit. The method includes the steps of providing a water-resistant sleeve shaped and dimensioned to fit over a portion of the body of a user. The sleeve includes a distal end, and a proximate end. The sleeve provides an elongate pliable stretchable strand including an elongate elastic inner core, and a sheathing around the core. The core and sheathing take on a flatter configuration when the strand is stretched and drawn around the portion of the body of a user. The method also includes the steps of forming at least one hole through the proximate end of the sleeve; folding the proximate end to form a hem circumscribing the proximate end; inserting an insulator in the proximate end; heat sealing the hem; and, inserting the elongate pliable strand through the hole to circumscribe the proximate end in the hem.</p>

Sleeve <b>10</b> is presently fabricated from plastic, but can be fabricated from any other waterproof or water resistant material. As used herein, water resistant materials include both waterproof material and material which resist penetration by water. Sleeve <b>10</b> includes distal end <b>41</b> and proximate end <b>42</b>. Proximate end <b>42</b> is the end closest to the user's body when the sleeve <b>10</b> is worn in the desired orientation. Distal end <b>41</b> is the end furthest from the user's body when the sleeve <b>10</b> is worn in the desired orientation. Distal end <b>41</b> need not cover the hand or other distal portion of an extremity. For example, distal end <b>41</b> might only extend to the wrist of a user's am and not extend over the hand.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">Hem <b>11</b> is connected to proximate end <b>42</b>. Hem <b>11</b> can be connected by being integrally formed with end <b>42</b>, by being stitched to end <b>42</b>, or by any other desired means. Hem <b>11</b> functions to direct and to channel elastic strip <b>12</b> around the perimeter of sleeve <b>10</b>. Hem <b>11</b> includes open ends or mouths <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, hem <b>11</b> comprises one long continuous channel or &#x201c;tunnel&#x201d;. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, hem <b>11</b> can comprises a plurality of spaced apart channels, in the same fashion that belt loops on a pair of pants function as a hem for a belt. Hem <b>11</b> comprises a pliable material which can fold like an accordion when strip <b>12</b> is pulled out of hem <b>11</b> to draw closed the opening in end <b>42</b> circumscribed by hem <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Although the shape and dimension of strip <b>12</b> can vary as desired, strip <b>12</b> is preferably flat, like a shoe lace, and has, in its normal unstretched state, a width W<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the range of 3 mm to 10 mm, and a thickness T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the range of 0.3 to 2 mm. This relatively flat, narrow configuration is preferred in the practice of the invention. If strip <b>12</b> is wider, there is a tendency to compress a user's arm or other extremity over a wider area and to interfere with the user's blood circulation. Likewise, if strip <b>12</b> is less wide, there is a tendency for the strip <b>12</b> to sink or cut into skin, muscle, or other tissue comprising the user's extremity and to restrict the user's blood circulation. If strip <b>12</b> is wider, greater frictional forces are generated which make it more difficult for strip <b>12</b> to slide through hem <b>11</b>. Similarly, if the thickness, T, is too small, strip <b>12</b> tends to roll up and cut into the tissue comprising the user's extremity. If the thickness, T, is too great, the it is more difficult to readily stretch strip <b>12</b> and to move strip <b>12</b> through hem <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">Strip <b>12</b> should, when a tensile force of only three to ten pounds is applied, be able to be stretched from its normal unstretched state to a length which is one and one-half to three times its length in its normal unstretched state.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The use of a relatively narrow, flat, elastic strip <b>12</b> which can be stretched with the application of relatively little force is important in the practice of the invention, because when the strip <b>12</b> is stretched to press and seal the proximate end <b>42</b> against a user's arm or other extremity, strip <b>12</b> still readily expands and contracts with and permits movement of the muscle and other tissue adjacent strip <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, strip <b>12</b> is shown in its normal, unstretched state and has a width W<b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, strip <b>12</b> is stretched because it is pulled in the directions of arrow B and C and subjected to a tensile force in the range of three to ten pounds. When strip <b>12</b> is stretched, it contracts and tapers, i.e., its width and thickness become less. Width W<b>1</b> is greater than width W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">The characteristics of strip <b>12</b> discussed above facilitate the one-handed operation of the engagement system <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">The shape and dimension of engagement system <b>15</b> can vary as desired. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, a variety of engagement systems can be constructed to perform the functions of system <b>15</b>. While the engagement system <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b> is unitary, system <b>15</b> can include two or more parts, some of which may move with respect to other parts in system <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">System <b>15</b> comprises an egg-shaped elastic member having a pair of generally circular apertures <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> extending therethrough. A slot extends between apertures <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. The slot includes opposing sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. An elongate notch <b>23</b> formed in side <b>21</b> receives and conforms to an elongate tooth <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) formed in side <b>22</b>. When the ends <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> of system <b>15</b> are grasped between the thumb and index finger of one hand and are compressed to generate forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>, system <b>15</b> takes on the generally circular shape <b>15</b>A depicted in FIG. <b>3</b>. When system <b>15</b> takes on the circular shape of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are displaced away from one another to form an opening or channel which extends completely through system <b>15</b>. This opening permits strip <b>12</b> to be readily pulled and stretched through the opening. After strip <b>12</b> is pulled the desired distance through the opening, the compressive forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> are released and system <b>15</b> returns to the egg-shaped configuration of FIG. <b>2</b>. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> compress and frictionally engage strip <b>12</b>. Tooth <b>25</b> also compresses strip <b>12</b> into notch <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>15</b> is mounted on strip <b>12</b> such that ends <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> extend through system <b>15</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, dashed lines <b>15</b>A represent system <b>15</b> when it has been temporarily compressed into the spherical configuration <b>15</b>A shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a section view of the system <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> taken along section lines <b>7</b>&#x2014;<b>7</b> thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the &#x201c;bunching&#x201d; of strip <b>12</b> which takes place during utilization of strip <b>12</b> and system <b>15</b>. In use, sleeve <b>10</b> is placed on the arm (or other extremity) of a user in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>15</b> is held between the thumb and index finger on the right or left hand of a user and is compressed to produce forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> and to produce spherical configuration <b>15</b>A. Ends <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are pulled in the direction of arrow S (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) through the opening (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) formed in system <b>15</b>. This pulling of ends <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> can be accomplished with the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th </sup>fingers of the same hand which is holding system <b>15</b> between the thumb and index finger of the hand. Ends <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are pulled in the direction of arrow S a distance sufficient to stretch strip <b>12</b> around arm <b>18</b> and sealingly compress the proximate end <b>42</b> of sleeve <b>10</b> against arm <b>18</b>. System <b>15</b> is slid along strip <b>12</b> until system <b>15</b> is also adjacent arm <b>18</b>. Forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> are released, i.e., system <b>15</b> is no longer compressed between the thumb and index finger. When forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> are released, system <b>15</b> returns to the egg-shaped configuration shown in FIG. <b>2</b> and sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> frictionally engage and compress strip <b>12</b>. The portion of strip <b>12</b> which extends outwardly away from system <b>15</b> in the direction of T in FIG. <b>7</b> and around arm <b>18</b> is stretched. The portion of each end <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of strip <b>12</b> which extends outwardly away from system <b>15</b> and arm <b>18</b> in the direction of arrow V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is not stretched, but is in its normal unstretched state. The stretched portion of strip <b>12</b> is trying to pulled the unstretched portion of strip <b>12</b> into system <b>15</b>. But the portions of system <b>15</b>, namely sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, which frictionally compress and engage strip <b>12</b> prevent this from happening. Consequently, the unstretched portion of strip <b>12</b> adjacent system <b>15</b> tends to &#x201c;bunch&#x201d; against side <b>50</b> of system <b>15</b> in the manner shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. The bunched portion of strip <b>12</b> is wider than the stretched portion. The bunched portion of strip <b>12</b> against side <b>50</b> tends to stabilize strip <b>12</b> in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> because the &#x201c;bunching&#x201d; makes it more difficult for the bunched portion to slide into system <b>15</b> between sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. A method of accentuating this phenomenon is to make the height H of sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> less than the width W<b>1</b> of strip <b>12</b> when strip <b>12</b> is not stretched. This allows strip <b>12</b> to more readily pass through system <b>15</b> when strip <b>12</b> is stretched and makes it increasingly difficult for the unstretched, bunched portion of strip <b>12</b> to slide into system <b>15</b> between sides <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">System <b>15</b> can be shaped and dimensioned so that it can be held and squeezed between the user's teeth to generate the forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> necessary to produce spherical shape <b>15</b>A. When spherical shape <b>15</b>A is produced, the user needs only a single hand to pulls the ends <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of strip <b>12</b> through the opening formed in system <b>15</b>. Consequently, the user can, with the free hand which will not be covered by sleeve <b>10</b>, pull sleeve <b>10</b> over the other hand and arm <b>18</b>, can use his teeth to generate forces F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> on system <b>15</b> to produce sphere <b>15</b>A, and can use his free hand to pull strip <b>12</b> through the opening in sphere <b>15</b>A.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">System <b>15</b> functions to permit a first opening to be formed which facilitates sliding strip <b>12</b> through the opening. System <b>15</b> also functions to permit a second opening to be formed which prevents or tends to prevent strip <b>12</b> from sliding through the second opening. The second opening can be formed by modifying or changing the shape of the first opening.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">Sleeve <b>10</b> is presently formed from a polymer or other pliable water resistant material which has a thickness in the range of one to eight mils, preferably three to six mils. The material used to fabricate sleeve <b>10</b> can vary as desired, as can the shape and dimension of sleeve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, sleeve <b>10</b> can also be sized to be installed over and extend around the chest, mid-section, neck, or head of a user's body.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another water resistant sleeve <b>100</b> shaped and dimensioned to fit over the lower arm of an individual. Sleeve <b>100</b> is presently fabricated from plastic, but can be fabricated from any other waterproof or water resistant material. Sleeve <b>100</b> includes distal end <b>141</b> and proximate end <b>142</b>. Proximate end <b>142</b> is the end closest to the user's body when the sleeve <b>100</b> is worn in the desired orientation. Distal end <b>141</b> is the end furthest from the user's body when the sleeve <b>100</b> is worn in the desired orientation. Distal end <b>141</b> need not cover the hand or other distal portion of an extremity. For example, distal end <b>141</b> might only extend to the wrist of a user's arm and not extend over the hand.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">Hem <b>111</b> is formed on proximate end <b>142</b>. Hem <b>111</b> functions to direct and to channel elastic strip <b>112</b> freely continuously around the perimeter of sleeve <b>100</b>. Hem <b>111</b> includes openings <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, hem <b>111</b> forms one long continuous inner channel <b>144</b>. Draw string <b>112</b> extends through channel <b>144</b> around proximate end <b>142</b> and out through opening <b>116</b>. The entire length of draw string <b>112</b> that extends through channel <b>144</b> is free to slidably move along channel <b>144</b>. This is important in the practice of the invention. Some prior art units &#x201c;tack&#x201d; down or fix part of hem <b>111</b> and an intermediate portion of string <b>112</b>. Such a &#x201c;tacking&#x201d; prevents string <b>112</b> from freely sliding through channel <b>144</b>. The free movement of string <b>112</b> through channel <b>144</b> is important in producing a generally uniform seal around proximate end <b>142</b> when string <b>112</b> is tightened by drawing ends through an engagement system <b>15</b>. Hem <b>11</b> comprises a pliable material which can fold like an accordion when portions of string <b>112</b> are pulled out of hem <b>111</b> through opening <b>116</b> to draw closed the opening in end <b>142</b> circumscribed by hem <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">Although the shape and dimension and construction of string <b>112</b> can vary as desired, in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, string <b>112</b> is preferably cylindrical and has the construction discussed below and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref> to <b>11</b>. The flat construction illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> to <b>5</b> has a disadvantage in that it tends to twist inside the hem, preventing a flat surface from continuously pressing against the user's skin when the strip is tightened about the body portion of the user.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">In its normal unstretched state, the width or diameter, indicated by arrows V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, of string <b>112</b> is in the range of 1 mm to 10 mm. String <b>112</b> includes a core <b>131</b> fabricated from rubber or some other elastic material, and includes a sheathing <b>130</b> woven from nylon, cotton, wool, or some other fabric. The sheathing <b>130</b> has the ability to stretch or distend elastically when core <b>131</b> is elastically stretched. However, sheathing <b>130</b> ordinarily does not have the ability to stretch as much as core <b>131</b> can stretch; consequently, sheathing <b>130</b> tends to limit the amount core <b>131</b> stretches. When string <b>112</b> is in its normal unstretched &#x201c;at rest&#x201d; configuration, string <b>112</b> has the generally cylindrical cross-sectional area illustrated in FIG. <b>10</b>. When string <b>112</b> is elastically stretched in hem <b>111</b> around the portion of the user's body in the directions indicated by arrow(s) X and/or W, string <b>112</b> flattens and tends to more evenly distribute the compressive force generated by string <b>112</b> over a wider area of the user's body. When, however, the string <b>112</b> is not being elastically stretched, the cylindrical shape of the string facilitates sliding the string through hem <b>111</b>. Even if string <b>112</b> twists, string <b>112</b> still generally retains its cylindrical shape.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">Strip <b>112</b> should, when a tensile force of only three to ten pounds is applied, be able to be stretched from its normal unstretched state to a length which is one and one-half to five times its length in its normal unstretched state. The use of a cylindrical elastic string or strip <b>112</b> which flattens when stretched is important in the practice of the invention, because when the string <b>112</b> is stretched to press and seal the proximate end <b>142</b> against and about a user's arm or other extremity, string <b>112</b> still readily flattens to distribute the compressive force generated by string over a larger area of the user's body.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">The characteristics of string <b>112</b> discussed above facilitate the one-handed operation of the engagement system <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">System <b>15</b> can be mounted on string <b>112</b> and operated in the same manner earlier discussed with respect to strip <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">Sleeve <b>100</b> is presently formed from a polymer or other pliable water resistant material which has a thickness in the range of one to eight mils, preferably three to six mils.

<p id="P-00056" num="00056">A method for fabricating sleeve <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> to <b>15</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> a plastic bag <b>143</b> includes distal end <b>141</b> and proximate end <b>142</b>. Bag <b>143</b> is placed in the flattened orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13. A</figref> punch, die cutter, or other cutting tool is used to cut through bag <b>143</b> to form openings <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>. If desired, only a single opening <b>116</b> (or <b>117</b>) can be formed in bag <b>143</b>. Openings <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> can be cut individually or simultaneously. When openings <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> are cut simultaneously, the cutting tool pierces one side of end <b>142</b> to cut opening <b>116</b> and continues through the other side of end <b>142</b> to cut opening <b>117</b> immediately beneath and in registration with opening <b>116</b>.</p>
