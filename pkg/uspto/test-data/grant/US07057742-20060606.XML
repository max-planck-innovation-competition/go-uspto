<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Frequency-scanning interferometry exploits relationships between interference and beam frequency to measure path length differences between interfering object and reference beams.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional interferometers arranged for comparing object and reference surfaces using the mechanism of interference generally require illuminating and imaging systems that are matched in size to the size of the object surface. Typically, the illuminating systems collimate the object and reference beams at a common diameter encompassing the desired measurement area of the object surface. Imaging systems collect the collimated object and reference beams following respective reflections from object and reference surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, the sizes of the object and reference beams are not significantly affected by their encounters with (e.g., reflections from) the object and reference surfaces. If the object and reference beams are produced by the illuminating system as expanding beams, even larger diameter imaging optics are required to collect the object and imaging beams following their encounters with the object and reference surfaces because the beams continue to expand following their encounters. The illuminating systems generally employ expensive collimating optics so that individual rays of the object and reference beams approach the object and reference surfaces at normal incidence or at least at a constant angle of incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The measurements carried out by conventional interferometers compare object surfaces to reference surfaces that share the same nominal geometric form as the object surfaces. Differences between the object and reference surfaces measured as path length variations between the object and reference beams are generally attributed to errors in the object surface. Accordingly, the reference surfaces are generally made as accurately as possible. Most reference surfaces are highly polished mirrors that exhibit spectral reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The unambiguous measurement interval of conventional interferometers is related to the central wavelength (frequency) of the object and reference beams. Interference patterns produced by overlapping images of the object and reference surfaces contain fringe patterns of constructive and destructive interference between the object and reference beams. A single cycle of constructive and destructive interference between adjacent fringes is the unambiguous measurement interval. Fringes produced by reflective surfaces at normal incidence in a single pass have fringe spacings representing surface height variations of the object surface equal to one-half of the central wavelength of the interfering beams. Given the usual range of optically transmissive wavelengths, this has two main effects. First, very smooth (e.g., specular) reference surfaces are required. Second, only object surfaces having limited roughness can be unambiguously measured.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Multiple wavelength interferometers can be used for expanding the unambiguous measurement interval of conventional interferometers. Broad-band interferometers, also referred to as &#x201c;white light&#x201d; interferometers, expand the measurement interval by measuring a succession of physical displacements between object and reference surfaces required to identify points of peak interference contrast that occur at equal optical path length differences between the object and reference surfaces. The amounts of displacement required to position each point on the object surface at an equal optical path length with a corresponding point on the reference surface are measured to map the surface topology of the object surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Frequency-scanning interferometers, also referred to as wavelength-scanning interferometers or multi-wavelength interferometers, derive their broader range of measurement from a plurality of interference patterns produced at a succession of different beam frequencies (or wavelengths). In contrast to conventional interferometers that compare path length differences between points within the same interference patterns and use additional interference patterns to make finer measures or to resolve ambiguities within the unambiguous measurement interval, frequency-scanning interferometers can measure points common to the plurality of interference patterns individually, based upon interferometric (e.g., intensity or phase) fluctuations of the corresponding points within the plurality of interference patterns produced at different beam frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As such, a wider range of surface roughness can be unambiguously measured by frequency-scanning interferometers. Conventional interferometers are typically limited to measuring step sizes in the direction of illumination within the fringe spacing of their interference patterns, which relate directly to the wavelength of the illumination. The measurement of such step sizes by frequency-scanning interferometers is normally independent of the nominal wavelength of illumination, depending instead on the average interval between the beam frequencies. The finer the interval, the larger the range of unambiguous measurement. Thus, frequency-scanning interferometers can provide measures of rough or diffuse object surfaces at beam frequencies that produce speckle-ridden interference patterns unintelligible to conventional interferometers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Frequency-scanning interferometers are especially useful for measuring surface profiles (topographies) of test objects as measures of surface variations taken normal to a reference plane or surface. Recent developments of frequency-scanning interferometry include the use of components such as tunable diode lasers and CCD detector arrays. As a result, compact, accurate, and fast systems have been developed, which have the capability of performing measurements for a wide range of test surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A known frequency-scanning interferometer system <b>10</b> is depicted in FIG. <b>1</b>. While in the overall form of a Twyman-Green interferometer, a tunable laser <b>12</b> under the control of a computer <b>14</b> produces a measuring beam <b>16</b> that can be tuned through a range of different frequencies. An illuminating system including beam conditioning optics <b>18</b> expand and collimate the measuring beam <b>16</b>. A folding mirror <b>20</b> directs the measuring beam <b>16</b> to a beamsplitter <b>22</b> that divides the measuring beam <b>16</b> into a object beam <b>24</b> and a reference beam <b>26</b>. The object beam <b>24</b> retroreflects from a test object <b>30</b>, and the reference beam <b>26</b> retroreflects from a reference mirror <b>32</b>. The beamsplitter <b>22</b> recombines the object beam <b>24</b> and the reference beam <b>26</b>, and imaging optics <b>34</b> (such as a lens or group of lenses) of an imaging system focus overlapping images of the test object <b>30</b> and the reference mirror <b>32</b> onto a detector array <b>36</b> (such as a CCD array of elements). The detector array <b>36</b> records the interferometric values of an interference pattern produced by path length variations between the object and reference beams <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Outputs from the detector array <b>36</b> are stored and processed in the computer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The elements (pixels) of the detector array <b>36</b> record local interferometric values subject to the interference between the object and reference beams <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Each of the interferometric values is traceable to a spot on the test object <b>30</b>. However, instead of comparing interferometric values between the array elements (pixels) to determine phase differences between the object and reference beams <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> throughout an interference pattern as a primary measure of surface variation, a set of additional interference patterns is recorded for a series of different beam frequencies (or wavelengths) of the measuring beam <b>16</b>. The tunable laser <b>12</b> is stepped through a succession of incrementally varying beam frequencies, and the detector array <b>36</b> records the corresponding interference patterns. Data frames recording individual interference patterns numbering 16 or 32 frames are typical.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The local interferometric values vary in a sinusoidal manner with the changes in beam frequency, cycling between conditions of constructive and destructive interference. The rate of interferometric variation, e.g., the frequency of intensity variation, is a function of the path length differences between the local portions of the object and reference beams <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Gradual changes in intensity (lower interference frequency variation) occur at small path length differences, and more rapid changes in intensity (higher interference frequency variation) occur at large path length differences.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Discrete Fourier transforms can be used within the computer <b>14</b> to identify the interference frequencies of interferometric (e.g., intensity) variation accompanying the incremental changes in the beam frequency of the measuring beam <b>16</b>. The computer <b>14</b> also converts the interference frequencies of interferometric variation into measures of local path length differences between the object and reference beams <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, which can be used to construct a three-dimensional image of the test object <b>30</b> as measures of profile differences from a surface of the reference mirror <b>32</b>. Since the reference mirror <b>32</b> is planar, the determined optical path differences are equivalent to deviations of the object <b>30</b> from a plane. The resulting three-dimensional topographical information can be further processed to measure important characteristics of the object <b>30</b> (e.g. flatness or parallelism), which are useful for quality control of precision manufactured parts.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Although frequency-scanning interferometers can be used to measure object surfaces having a much greater range of surface roughness than can be measured by conventional interferometers, the dimensions of the illuminating and imaging optics remain much the same. For example, the beam conditioning optics <b>18</b> are sized to expand and collimate the measuring beam <b>16</b> so that the object beam <b>24</b> and the reference beam <b>26</b> encompass similarly sized areas of the test object <b>30</b> and the reference mirror <b>32</b>. The imaging optics <b>34</b> are similarly dimensioned to focus the reflected but still collimated object and reference beams <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> onto the detector array <b>36</b>. Thus, the size of the illuminating and imaging systems is matched to the size of the test object <b>30</b> and reference mirror <b>32</b>. The cost of such optical systems becomes prohibitively expensive for measuring large test objects and can remain considerable even for measuring small test objects. Collimating optics, especially those sized for measuring large test objects are particularly expensive and occupy considerable space, which are detrimental to making more compact interferometer systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention includes a discovery that the illuminating and imaging systems of a frequency-scanning interferometer can be sized independently of the size of a test object surface by fashioning the reference surface as a non-specular or diffuse surface. The reference beam is altered by an encounter with the non-specular or diffuse reference surface so that a representative portion of the reference beam can be captured by the imaging system. A representative portion of the object beam can be similarly captured by the imaging system by encountering a non-specular or diffuse surface of the test object as is typical of machined surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Illuminating optics can be made much smaller and simplified by producing an expanding beam for illuminating the object and reference surfaces. The non-specular or diffuse reference surface alters the reference beam so that a representative (i.e., generally pervasive) portion of the expanding beam propagates along a converging path to the imaging optics. Thus, the imaging optics can be reduced in size as well. Although the angles at which individual rays of the reference beam depart from the reference surface can vary widely or even randomly over the traverse area of the reference surface, the optical path lengths through the imaging system to corresponding points of focus are not affected by such angular variation. Field-dependent variations in incident angles associated with spherically diverging forms of the object and reference beams can be accommodated by well-defined calibrations (i.e., scale factors). Accordingly, path length differences between the object and reference beams continue to provide a comparison between the object and reference surfaces despite the beam alterations attendant to the non-specular or diffuse form of the object and reference surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One example of an interferometer benefiting from the invention includes an illuminating system that illuminates an object surface with an object beam and a reference surface with a reference beam. An imaging system produces overlapping images of the object surface and the reference surface for gathering interferometric data based on path length differences between the object and reference beams. A frequency regulator regulates a frequency of the object and reference beams at which interferometric data is gathered over a range of different frequencies. A processor converts variations in the interferometric data as a function of beam frequency into measures of the path length differences between the object and reference beams. In contrast to prior practices, the reference surface is substantially non-specular so that the reference beam is altered upon reflection to enhance the imaging of the reference surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The reference surface preferably has a nominal geometric surface form; and measured with respect to normals to the surface form, rays of the reference beam reflect from the reference surface at angles that depart from angles at which the reference beam rays are incident upon the reference surface. For example, the reference surface can be a nominally planar surface, and the interferometric data can contain information relating to differences between the object surface and the nominally planar form of the reference surface. The reference beam propagates toward the reference surface along an optical axis, and more rays of the reference beam converge toward the optical axis immediately after reflection from the reference surface than immediately before reflection from the reference surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The non-specular property of the reflective reference surface can also be defined as a form of dispersion, which can be structured or unstructured. For example, the non-specular or dispersion properties of the reference surface can produce a random or an ordered alteration of the reference beam. Preferably, the alteration is largely random causing the rays of the reference beam to scatter upon reflection from the reference surface. However, the alteration can include beam-shaping properties for such purposes as controlling and distributing beam contents within a prescribed form. The random component of the alteration of the reference beam can be characterized as reducing spatial coherence or as reducing anisotropic reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The illuminating system can be arranged to produce non-collimated object and reference beams that expand upon approach to the object and reference surfaces. Representative (i.e., generally pervasive) portions of both the object beam and the reference beam reflect from the object and reference surfaces on converging paths toward the imaging system. The preferred imaging system has a imaging aperture area, and the object surface imaged by the imaging system has a transverse area that is larger than the imaging aperture area. In addition, the preferred illuminating system has an illuminating aperture area, and the transverse area of the object surface imaged by the imaging system is larger than the imaging aperture area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The frequency-scanning interferometer preferably includes a data acquisition system for acquiring the interferometric data at a plurality of different frequencies of the object and reference beams. The interferometric data contains information relating to differences between the object surface and the reference surface gathered as a result of reflections from both surfaces. The interferometric data for local areas within the overlapping images of the object and reference surfaces cycles through conditions of constructive and destructive interference with progressive variation in the beam frequencies. The processor converts the cyclical variations of the interferometric data as a function of frequency into the path length differences between the object and reference beams. The processor also preferably provides for converting the path length differences between the object and reference beams into measures of departures of the object surface from the nominal geometric surface form of the reference surface.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The reference beam has a nominal wavelength, and the non-specular or diffuse nature of the reference surface introduces path length variations into the reference beam. In fact, the path length variations introduced by the reference surface into the reference beam can be of an order that is near or even beyond a fringe spacing of the interference patterns. The interferometric data, however, preferably incorporates information about surface height variations of the object surface of an order that is well beyond the nominal wavelength of the reference beam. For comparing the object and reference surfaces to each other, the path length variations introduced by the reference surface into the reference beam are preferably of an order of magnitude smaller than the surface height variations of the object surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One or more beam filters can be incorporated into the frequency scanning interferometer for conditioning the object and reference beams. For example, a beam filter can be positioned between the illuminating and imaging systems for matching overall beam strength between the object and reference beams. The same or an additional filter can be used to more evenly distribute beam intensity throughout the beam aperture. Overall, the filters provide for scaling intensity and contrast of the interference patterns to the optimum ranges of the data acquisition system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention can significantly reduce the cost and complexity of frequency-scanning interferometers by making a fundamental modification to the form of the reference surface used in the interferometer. A recognition of the attendant changes made possible by the modified reference surface is also required to fully exploit the invention. For example, the recognition should include an appreciation that a non-specular or diffuse reference surface is capable of making a representative portion of an otherwise expanding reference beam available to an imaging system at a reduced aperture dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The recognition should also include an appreciation that the optical path lengths between the object and reference beams through the imaging system are not affected by the different angles of reflection through which the non-specular reference surface redirects portions of the reference beam. Moreover, the recognition should include an appreciation that the field-dependent incident angle variations associated with diverging object and reference beams can be accommodated by predetermined calibrations (i.e., scale factors) and are not subject to information losses otherwise accompanying fringe density variations of conventional interferometers. In other words, the disordered angular departures caused by diffusion can be accommodated by conjugate imaging, and the ordered angular departures caused by diverging illumination can be accommodated by applying field-dependent scale factors. Variations in fringe density accompanying the field-dependent variations in angles of incidence are not problematic to frequency-scanning interferometry; because unlike conventional interferometry, the resolution of path length variations is independent of nominal wavelength-related factors.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention is most applicable to a frequency-scanning interferometer of a type that produces a series of interference patterns between object and reference beams over the range of different frequencies. The object beam encounters an object surface, the reference beam encounters a reference surface, and the series of interference patterns are subject to differences between the object and reference surfaces. One expression of the proposed improvement includes forming the reference surface as a diffuse surface for altering the reference beam.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the diffuse surface produces a largely random alteration of the reference beam. For example, the diffuse surface can be arranged for scattering the reference beam throughout a range of different directions and thereby reduce anisotropic reflection of the reference beam. However, the diffuse surface can include beam-shaping structures that produce an at least partially ordered alteration of the reference beam. For example, such beam-shaping structures can be used to alter a distribution of beam components within the reference beam.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The reference beam contains a plurality of rays, and the rays of the reference beam subject to random alteration propagate in an increased number of directions after encountering the reference surface. The reference beam propagates toward the reference surface along an optical axis; and whether the alteration is random or ordered, an increasing percentage of the rays of the reference beam preferably converge toward the optical axis after encountering the diffuse reference surface.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The diffuse reference surface introduces path length variations between the object and reference beams that can at least partially obscure the identification of interference fringes in the interference patterns. However, surface height variations of the object surface introduce path length variations between the object and reference beams of an order of magnitude or more larger than the path length variations introduced by the diffuse reference surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Overall, the diffuse reference surface has a nominal geometric form, and the series of interference patterns record differences between the object surface and the nominal geometric form of the diffuse reference surface. For example, the nominal geometric form of the diffuse reference surface can be a plane. For reducing the size of illuminating and imaging optics, the reference beam can be propagated toward the nominally planar reference surface as an expanding beam and a representative portion of the reference beam can be propagated away from the nominally planar reference surface as a converging beam.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention also spawns new methods of interferometrically measuring surface features of test objects. An object surface can be illuminated with an object beam, and a reference surface can be illuminated with a reference beam. The object beam is non-specularly reflected from the object surface and the reference beam is non-specularly reflected from the reference beam so that directional components of the object and reference beams are altered upon reflection. Overlapping images of the object and reference surfaces are produced for gathering interferometric data based on path length differences between the object and reference beams. A frequency of the object and reference beams at which interferometric data is gathered is regulated over a range of different frequencies. Variations in the interferometric data as a function of frequency are converted into measures of the path length differences between the object and reference beams.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the non-specular reflection produces a largely random alteration of the reference beam. For example, the non-specular reflection can scatter the reference beam throughout a range of different directions and thereby reduce anisotropic reflection of the reference beam. Alternatively, the non-specular reflection can produce an at least partially ordered alteration of the reference beam.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The reference beam preferably expands along a path of propagation toward the reference surface and includes a representative portion that contracts along a path of propagation away from the reference surface. The illumination of both the object surface and the reference surface is preferably accomplished without collimating optics.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A series of interference patterns are produced from the overlapping images over the range of discrete frequencies, and the step of non-specularly reflecting includes introducing path length variations between the object and reference beams that at least partially obscure the identification of interference fringes in the interference patterns. However, the path length variations introduced by the reference surface are of an order of magnitude or more less than path length variations introduced by the object surface.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An embodiment of the invention as a modified frequency-scanning interferometer <b>50</b> arranged for measuring a diffuse object surface <b>52</b> is shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The frequency-scanning interferometer <b>50</b> is configured generally as a Twyman-Green interferometer, but other known interferometer configurations could also be used. However, unlike conventional Twyman-Green interferometers, no collimating optics are employed and a reference surface <b>56</b> is arranged as a non-specular or diffuse surface.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A radiation source <b>62</b> associated with an illuminating system <b>60</b> produces an expanding measuring beam <b>66</b>. Beam conditioning optics <b>64</b> control expansion of the measuring beam <b>66</b> to fill corresponding aperture dimensions of the object surface <b>52</b> and the reference surface <b>56</b>. Preferably, the radiation source <b>62</b> is a point source of coherent radiation, such as a diode laser (e.g., a GaAs-based laser), tunable through a limited range of frequencies (or wavelengths). The expanding measuring beam <b>66</b> preferably has a well-defined structure, such as a spherically diverging wavefront. A choice of nominal wavelength (e.g., 780 nm) can be made within the visible or invisible spectrum and can be selected on such bases as cost, resolution, and reflectance of the test object <b>54</b>. A frequency-tunable laser preferred for the practice of this invention is disclosed in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/446,012, filed May 27, 2003, entitled TUNABLE LASER SYSTEM HAVING AN ADJUSTABLE EXTERNAL CAVITY, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A beamsplitter <b>70</b> divides the expanding measuring beam <b>66</b> into an expanding object beam <b>72</b> and an expanding reference beam <b>76</b>. The expanding object beam <b>72</b> propagates along an optical axis <b>71</b> to the object surface <b>52</b> of a test object <b>54</b>, and the expanding reference beam <b>76</b> propagates along an optical axis <b>75</b> to the reference surface <b>56</b> of a reference element <b>58</b>. The expanding object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> preferably encounter the object and reference surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> at angles of incidence that are well-defined with respect to their respective optical axes <b>71</b> and <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Both the object surface <b>52</b> and the reference surface <b>56</b> are non-specular or diffuse reflective surfaces. The object <b>54</b> can be a machined part with the object surface <b>52</b> having a surface roughness that tends to scatter incident radiation. The reference surface <b>56</b> of the reference element <b>58</b> is specifically fashioned as a non-specular or diffuse reflective surface. Preferably, the non-specular reflection from the reference surface scatters the reference beam <b>76</b> throughout a range of different directions. As a result of such scattering, which can be random or partially ordered, a representative portion <b>74</b> of the object beam <b>72</b> is reflected from the object surface <b>52</b> along the optical axis <b>71</b> on a converging return path to the beamsplitter <b>70</b>, and a representative portion <b>78</b> of the reference beam <b>76</b> is reflected from the reference surface <b>56</b> along the optical axis <b>75</b> on a converging return path to the beamsplitter <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The representative portions <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> of the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> preferably emanate from throughout the aperture dimensions of the object surface <b>52</b> and the reference surface <b>56</b>. The beamsplitter <b>70</b> recombines and directs the representative portions <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> of the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> to an imaging system <b>80</b> containing focusing optics <b>82</b>, which produce overlapping images of the object surface <b>52</b> and reference surface <b>56</b>. The focusing optics <b>82</b> can be smaller and less complicated than usual because the representative portions <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> of the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> approach the focusing optics <b>82</b> within the bounds of converging beams. Propagating directions through the beamsplitter <b>70</b> can be governed by known polarization techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The focusing optics <b>82</b> of the imaging system <b>80</b> have an imaging aperture area, and the object surface <b>52</b> imaged by the focusing optics has a transverse area that is considerably larger than the imaging aperture area. Similarly, beam conditioning optics <b>64</b> of the illuminating system <b>60</b> have an illuminating aperture area, and the transverse area of the object surface <b>52</b> is larger than the illuminating aperture area. A traverse area of the reference surface <b>56</b> that is imaged by the focusing optics <b>82</b> is also larger than both the imaging aperture area and the illuminating aperture area.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A data acquisition system <b>84</b> including a detector array <b>86</b>, which can be located in the focal plane of the focusing optics <b>82</b>, records details of interference patterns produced between the representative portions <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> of the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b>. The detector array <b>86</b> is preferably conjugate to both the object surface <b>52</b> and the reference surface <b>56</b> so that illuminated points on the two surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> are reproduced as corresponding points of focus on the detector array <b>86</b>. Thus, the light arriving at the points of focus can originate at a range of angles from the illuminated points on the two surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b>, while traversing the same optical path lengths between the conjugate points.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the detector array <b>86</b> is composed of an array of individually addressable elements (such as charge-coupled devices) for separately measuring intensity at different points in the interference patterns (i.e., the overlapping images of the object and reference surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b>). A computer <b>90</b> stores and processes the interferometric data (e.g., intensity) acquired by the detector array <b>86</b>. In addition, the computer <b>90</b> controls the radiation source <b>62</b> to incrementally shift the frequency of the measuring beam <b>66</b> for acquiring interferometric data from a series of interference patterns at the different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The intensity values &#x201c;I&#x201d; recorded by elements of the detector array <b>86</b> can be written as the sum of two coherent components; one from the object beam <b>72</b> &#x201c;U<sub>obj</sub>&#x201d; and one from the reference beam <b>76</b> &#x201c;U<sub>ref</sub>&#x201d; as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The recorded intensity &#x201c;I&#x201d; corresponds, for example, to the intensity measured by a pixel within the image produced by the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b>. The object beam <b>72</b> &#x201c;U<sub>obj</sub>&#x201d; can be written as:

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The intensity &#x201c;I&#x201d; described by the cosine term of Equation (5) depends upon both the path length difference &#x201c;R&#x201d; and the beam frequency &#x201c;&#x3bd;&#x201d;. For example, the cosine term of the intensity &#x201c;I&#x201d; represents the cycling of the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> through conditions of constructive and destructive interference as a function of the beam frequency &#x201c;&#x3bd;&#x201d;. The periodicity of the intensity variation (preferentially referred to as the interference frequency) changes proportional to the path length difference &#x201c;R&#x201d;. A determination of the interference frequency from the intensity data &#x201c;I&#x201d; gathered at a succession of &#x201c;N&#x201d; different beam frequencies &#x201c;&#x3bd;&#x201d; allows for the determination of the path length difference &#x201c;R&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Equation (5) also shows that the intensity &#x201c;I&#x201d; has two basic terms: a bias term equal to &#x201c;|A<sub>1</sub>|<sup>2</sup>+|A<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</sup>&#x201d; and a cosine term. The sinusoidal intensity variation of interest arises from the cosine term. The bias term is an offset that can be easily removed by computing the mean &#x201c;&#x12a;&#x201d; of the intensity data and subtracting this mean from Equation (5). The mean &#x201c;&#x12a;&#x201d; of the intensity data can be computed as follows:

Based on the incremental changes in beam frequency &#x201c;&#x3bd;&#x201d; provided by the tunable laser <b>62</b>, a value of &#x201c;R&#x201d; can be fit to the function using Fourier transform methods. The procedure involves recording the interference patterns for a series of &#x201c;N&#x201d; beam frequencies.

Techniques for expeditiously solving the Fourier transform are given in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/601,802, filed Jun. 23, 2003, now U.S. Pat.No. 6,741, 361, entitled MULTI-STAGE DATA PROCESSING FOR FREQUENCY-SCANNING INTERFEROMETER based on U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/391,004, filed Jun. 24, 2002, which are both hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In practice, it is desirable to have the intensity of the representative reference and object beam portions <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> be similar in strength. A neutral density filter <b>92</b> located along the optical axis <b>75</b> of the reference beam <b>76</b> can be used for this purpose. However, to prevent undesirable back reflections, the neutral density filter <b>92</b> is preferably tilted with respect to the reference surface <b>56</b>. An operator can tune the variable neutral density filter <b>92</b>, or the control computer <b>90</b> can be programmed to adjust the optical density of the filter <b>92</b> to optimize the imaging conditions for each frequency of the measuring beam. Such tuning can be accomplished, for example, by using several different filters of differing density values in a wheel arrangement that can be rotated to place the correct filter in the field of view.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">One or more apodizing filters (not shown) can be located along the paths of the object beam <b>72</b> and the reference beam <b>76</b> to better balance intensities throughout the beam apertures. Since reflections from both the object surface <b>52</b> and the reference surface <b>56</b> are expected to be stronger toward aperture centers where the paraxial reflections are approached, Gaussian apodizing filters are preferred. Together, the filters are intended to match intensity range data appearing in the interference patterns to the optimum performance range of the data array <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With both a diffuse object surface <b>52</b> and a diffuse reference surface <b>56</b> imaged onto the detector array <b>86</b>, the recorded interference patterns are expected to appear as random speckle patterns. The diffuse reference surface <b>56</b> is expected to introduce path length variations between the object and reference beams that at least partially obscure the identification of interference fringes in the interference patterns. The surface height variations of the diffuse object surface <b>52</b> introduce path length variations between the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b> of an order of magnitude or larger than the path length variations introduced by the diffuse reference surface <b>56</b>. Accordingly, the interference patterns are expected to record surface height variations well beyond the unambiguous range of conventional interferometers.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The value of a range ambiguity interval &#x201c;&#x394;R<sub>AMB</sub>&#x201d; for the frequency scanning interferometer <b>50</b> is given as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;R<sub>AMB</sub><i>=c/</i>2&#x394;&#x3bd;<sub>INC</sub>&#x2032;&#x2003;&#x2003;(9)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x201c;&#x394;&#x3bd;<sub>INC</sub>&#x201d; is the size of the beam frequency increment between intensity data point samples.
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The value of a range resolution &#x201c;&#x394;R<sub>RES</sub>&#x201d; corresponding to a single complete cycle of constructive and destructive interference within the entire range (or bandwidth) &#x201c;&#x394;&#x3bd;<sub>TOTAL</sub>&#x201d; of beam frequencies is given as:

</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Preferably, a scattering depth (i.e., surface height variation) of the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> is limited to a scattering depth not larger than the uncertainty of the measurement, thereby reducing blur of the optical path difference (OPD) measurement of the frequency-scanning interferometer <b>10</b>. Within the range resolution &#x201c;&#x394;R<sub>RES</sub>&#x201d;, significantly less measurement uncertainty can be achieved by more precisely locating the peak intensity frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Due to irregularities of diffusion, the speckle intensity can be low at specific points in the interference patterns. Such low points can cause signal dropouts, where the variations in interferometric data are obscured by system noise. The incidence of error can be minimized by arranging the detector array <b>86</b> to have a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the purpose. In addition, such dropouts can be easily eliminated by post processing using, for example, a median filter.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> can be formed, for example, as a diffuse reflective surface or as an optically diffuse layer (e.g., cellophane tape) applied to a surface of a mirror. The non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> can also be formed by many other techniques including depositing microscopic particles onto a surface or sand blasting or otherwise abrading a metal or other reflective surface. Generally, it is preferred that the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> angularly distributes incident radiation in a random manner throughout its effective aperture. However, at least partially ordered distributions of the incident radiation can be used for such purposes as more evenly filling the aperture of the imaging system <b>80</b>. Further technical advantages in interferometry arising from the use of a non-specular or diffuse reference surface <b>56</b> will become more apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a portion of the conventional specular reference surface <b>30</b>, as used in the interferometer <b>10</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>. Incident rays <b>100</b> reflect from the reference surface <b>30</b> obeying the law of reflection whereby the angle of reflection <b>104</b> is equal to the angle of incidence <b>106</b> referenced to the surface normal <b>108</b>. The reflected rays <b>110</b> form an unaltered portion of the reference beam <b>26</b> that must in turn be collected by the focusing optics <b>34</b>. Since the reference beam <b>26</b> is collimated and the reference beam is not altered by its reflection, the focusing optics must be sized comparable to the reference surface <b>30</b> to image the reference surface <b>30</b> onto the detector array <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an enlarged portion of the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> as used in the interferometer <b>50</b> of FIG. <b>2</b>. Although only one pair of incident and reflecting rays <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are shown, it is apparent that the incident rays <b>112</b> can be diffusely reflected in many directions referenced to a normal <b>116</b> to the nominally planar form of the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b>. The angle of reflection is determined by the local surface normal, which varies considerably with respect to the surface form normal <b>116</b>. However, measured with respect to the surface form normal <b>116</b>, the angle of incidence <b>118</b> is unchanged, but the angles of reflection <b>120</b> can vary widely. The scattering strength of the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> determines the breadth of the angular divergence of the reflected rays. Since the angular divergence of the reference beam <b>76</b> redirects some of the rays originally propagating on diverging paths into corresponding rays propagating on converging paths, the focusing optics <b>82</b> can be dimensioned much smaller while still collecting the representative portion <b>78</b> of the reference beam <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates some additional features of light scattered by the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b>. The features include dimensions <b>122</b> of a virtual detector pixel, which is the image of a detector pixel projected onto the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b>. An actual detector pixel thus collects light nominally from this dimensioned region. A scattering depth <b>124</b> is also shown, which is the range of depth values that contribute to the reflected reference beam. Because the reference surface <b>56</b> is diffuse, the number of scattered contributions and their relative phases are random variables. It follows that when there are several randomly phased contributions, as is the case here, the reference beam <b>76</b> is speckled. The statistical properties of the speckle are dictated by the geometry of the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> and also by properties of the imaging system impulse response (IPR) function and the detector pixel size <b>122</b> [see, for example, J. C. Dainty, editor, Laser Speckle and Related Phenomena, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984, which is hereby incorporated by reference].</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">There are two important effects. First, the amplitude of the reference beam <b>76</b> at each pixel is a random variable. Note, however, that the image formation process described herein works independently of the reference beam strength, and thus the random nature of the reference amplitude is not problematic. If, however, the amplitude is extremely small, so that the cosine modulation is below the noise level of the system, an erroneous range measurement could result. This effect is called a speckle dropout. The occurrence of speckle dropouts can be minimized by using detector pixels that are somewhat larger than the imaging system IPR. In general, the probability density function of the reference intensity becomes Gaussian and the detector pixel size <b>122</b> and IPR are chosen to minimize the probability of low reference strength. Furthermore, speckle dropouts are, in practice, isolated pixels that can be easily identified and removed by median filtering [see, for example, A. Rosenfeld and A. C. Kak, Digital Picture Processing, Vol. 1, Academic Press, New York, 1982, which is hereby incorporated by reference].</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A second effect of the non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> is that the depth values within a pixel region are distributed as shown in the FIG. <b>5</b>. For a given measurement, it is desirable to have this scattering depth to be unresolved by the depth measurement. For example, the beam frequencies and processing parameters could be set so that the depth measurements of the object surface <b>52</b> are made with a given resolution (e.g., 10 microns). The non-specular reference surface <b>56</b> could than be designed so that the scattering depth is much less than the given resolution (e.g., 10 microns). The resolved depth fluctuations encoded by the interference patterns would then be attributable to the object surface <b>52</b> under test.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Advantages of using a non-collimated illumination beam are apparent from FIG. <b>6</b>. The object and reference surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> are illuminated with non-collimated measuring beam <b>66</b> from the tunable laser radiation source <b>62</b>. Because the object surface <b>52</b> of the test object <b>54</b> and the reference surface <b>56</b> of the reference element <b>58</b> are both diffuse, some of the rays (i.e., representative portions <b>74</b>, <b>78</b> of the object and reference beams <b>72</b> and <b>76</b>) reflect from these surfaces along converging paths through the beamsplitter <b>70</b> and can be collected by the imaging system <b>80</b> through an effective aperture <b>128</b> that is smaller than the dimensions of the object and reference surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> that are imaged. In addition to obviating requirements for a collimating system, an effective aperture <b>130</b> of the illuminating system <b>60</b> is also much smaller than the imaged dimensions of the object and reference surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Due to the expanding form of the measuring beam <b>66</b>, the measured optical path difference (OPD) is not exactly parallel to the optical axes <b>71</b> and <b>75</b>. That is, the object and reference surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> are illuminated at field-dependent angles of incidence. Accordingly, height variations of the object surface <b>52</b> are related to the optical path difference (OPD) by a cosine of the angular departures (i.e., the field-dependent departures from normal incidence). Since the angular departures of the measuring beam <b>66</b> are known (e.g., as the contents of a spherically diverging wavefront), field-dependent scale factors can be used in processing the interferometric data from the detector array <b>86</b> to extract the component of the OPD that is parallel to the optical axes <b>71</b> and <b>75</b>. A curved reference surface can also be used to make a similar correction.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Variations and modifications in the described interferometer system using a non-specular reference surface will undoubtedly suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. For example, the invention is generally applicable to a range of interferometer types adaptable to the use of non-specular reference surfaces including other single-pass or double-pass interferometers nominally operated at normal or grazing incidence. As an alternative to laser tuning, frequency filters could be used in advance of the detector array to collect interferometric data at different frequencies. Accordingly, the foregoing description should be taken as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</p>
