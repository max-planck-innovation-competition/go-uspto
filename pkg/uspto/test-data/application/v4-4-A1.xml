        <?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
        <heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
        <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for improved yard and garden maintenance. More specifically the present invention relates to manual and powered leaf and debris plowing systems incorporating specialized fork and teeth designs.</p>
        <heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
        <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The maintenance of lawn debris can involve large efforts for users of manual equipment such as rakes. Alternatively, power assisted devices such as leaf blowers may also be employed to move the debris. In these cases, large piles of debris may build during the maintenance process. These tools also involve significant labor and stress on an individual operator and particularly place such strains on backs of the user.</p>
        <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Large, powered solutions such as fixtures placed on tractor equipment to vacuum or rake a garden or lawn may improve the conditions of stress on a user but may be expensive and involve significant storage requirements. These large solutions may also create a level of damage and stress to the lawn or garden due to their weight and the design of the tines used to rake the surface to capture and move debris.</p>

        <heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
        <p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention provides an improved apparatus for the collection or relocation of yard and garden debris during maintenance. Various examples of the present invention may be generically called a &#x201c;Leaf Caddy&#x201d; as a descriptor of related apparatus. A Leaf Caddy in its fundamental form may comprise a set of one or more wheels that support a frame with tines positioned in a forward portion of the frame. The one or more wheels support the bulk of the weight of the apparatus removing such burden from an operator who is performing lawn and garden maintenance. In an example, an operator may push the Leaf Caddy over a garden surface and the frame of the device may receive debris caught into its structure by the tines as they move over a garden surface that has debris upon it. In some examples, the debris may include one or more of leaves, twigs, fruits, nuts and other such debris. By catching the debris, the apparatus may allow the user to collect the debris and move it to a desired location. The designs improve upon current manual apparatus such as rakes because the weight of the apparatus and collected debris is supported upon a wheelbase to the ground.</p>
        <p id="p-0032" num="0031">An important aspect of a Leaf Caddy may be the design of the tines and how the tines are deployed. In a preferred example, the tines may sit on the front of the device and be positioned such that the tines point in an upward direction. The upward direction may be relative to the surface that the device rolls upon. The degree of upward tilt may be fixed upon manufacture or may have an adjustment capability as is described in following sections.</p>
        <p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a base example, a Leaf Caddy may comprise a set of two wheels and be pushed by an operator holding a handle that projects upwards from the main body of the device. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> an illustration of an example of a Leaf Caddy <b>100</b> is provided. The Leaf Caddy <b>100</b> may include a handle <b>101</b> for an operator to push the device. The handle <b>101</b> may be formed of solid materials such as wood, fiber based materials, metals, plastics or combinations of these. Other materials may be used so long as the resulting material or composite of materials provides a strong and, in preferred examples, light weight support for manually moving the device. The top portion may include a grip or a handle to assist positive holding by the user and to support a lifting motion if used. In some examples, different handle types may be placed or replaced on the device as an optional accessory. In an example, a handle may be a straight pole with a non-slip plastic grip affixed at the end.</p>
        <p id="p-0034" num="0033">The Leaf Caddy, <b>100</b> may have a set of wheels <b>102</b> that are affixed upon the body of the device. There may be numerous designs of the type of tire and the surface texture or &#x201c;treads&#x201d; that the wheels are formed into. In an example, Turf treads, which may be most common may have circumferential rows of chevron shaped tread blocks. These may provide a degree of traction on slick grass, while not digging up and damaging the turf. In another example, knobby, all-terrain treads may be used which may typically have large tread blocks and deeper grooves to provide traction in loose surfaces like dirt, sand or mud. In some examples knobby tires may have a herringbone tread pattern, such as may be observed on large devices such as a farm tractor. The knobby feature may have a high void area between the knobs to evacuate debris from the tire. In another example, ribbed treads have circumferential grooves and straight ribs that are either flat or slightly scalloped which may provide long life and a combination of aspects of turf and knobby tires. In some examples, the tires may be replaceable.</p>
        <heading id="h-0007" level="2">Leaf Caddy</heading>
        <p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrated example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, two wheels are employed for the device, but single wheel devices (with ball or spherical shaped tires) or devices with more than two tires are also consistent with the present description. In some examples these wheels may be rigidly affixed around a single axle and rotate on the axle. In other examples, the wheels may have ability to rotate around a point to assist in steering capability. Here as well, common tire materials may be employed for various design examples; however, it may be preferred that the resulting tires are as lightweight as possible. In some examples, a solid tire may be used; whereas, in other examples a hollow tire which may be inflated and may include an inner tube may be used.</p>
        <p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the wheels <b>102</b> may be located outboard of the body <b>103</b> of the leaf caddy <b>100</b>. In other examples, they may be located underneath and within the extents of the body. In such an example, the tires are riding upon a portion of a lawn or garden surface where the leaf caddy has picked up debris by its action.</p>
        <p id="p-0037" num="0036">The Leaf Caddy <b>100</b> may include a body <b>103</b> of the device. There may be numerous shapes consistent with a Leaf Caddy <b>100</b>, but a shape which includes a sloping front edge with attached teeth of fork <b>104</b> along the front may be preferred. In some examples, the sloping front edge may rise up to create a volume to catch debris in. In some examples, the structure of the attached teeth of the fork <b>104</b> may be affixed to the body <b>103</b> of the device with a hinge <b>105</b>. The hinge <b>105</b> may allow for the teeth of the fork <b>104</b> to flexibly rotate to a degree as the leaf caddy <b>100</b> is pushed across a lawn or garden surface which may have topographic rises and falls.</p>
        <heading id="h-0008" level="2">Fork and Teeth Designs</heading>
        <p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a &#x201c;fork&#x201d; <b>200</b>, which may be a combination of teeth, may include a single piece of material with cut outs to shape a linear deployment of teeth. In a specific example, teeth <b>201</b> of the device may be shaped as illustrated which may be termed finger type teeth that are one inch in diameter and rounded 180 degrees at the tip, other dimensions and shapes are possible. The teeth may be separated, as an example, 2 inches from center leaving a shape <b>202</b> between the teeth. In the example, the shape <b>202</b> may be rounded. In other examples angular intersections or more complicated shapes may be used. In some examples, the teeth may also have a curve of uniform or variable arc upward towards the tip with a protruding under belly. Various three dimensional shapes may be employed for different operational needs such as the type of grass, the type of soil, the prevalence of exposed tree roots and the like. In many examples, a design goal of the design of the shape of the teeth may be the elimination of the likelihood of the tips digging into the surface of the garden or law and the device is moved across it.</p>
        <p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, the body <b>103</b> of the leaf caddy in the region just next to the fork including the teeth may include a small roller type wheel. The roller wheel may be a one half inch diameter roller wheel, which may assist in keeping the teeth in the fork position at a fixed position above the surface. The maintenance of this separation from the surface enables effective capture of debris such as leaves and twigs.</p>
        <p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, each of the teeth <b>201</b> of a fork <b>200</b> may include a roller ball. In an example, a cutout in each tooth may allow a rotating structure such as a ball <b>211</b> or a wheel to be mounted on an axle <b>212</b>. The axle may be rigid and affixed to the fork/teeth material in some examples. In other examples of the present invention, the axle may be flexible allowing the ball a degree of flexibility in its position. In some examples, the balls may be a common dimension and shape for all teeth. In other examples, up to each (one up to all) of the balls may have unique characteristics such as their design, shape, texture, material composition and the like. In some examples, the balls may be replaced with rotating brushes that also support the tooth at a height above the surface. If the brushes are affixed upon a common rotating axle, a motive force may be applied to the axle to cause the brushes to rotate against the direction that they would move normally and provide a sweeping action as the leaf caddy moves forward.</p>
        <p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a further example, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, each tooth may have a rotating structure such as a ball <b>223</b> as described above held in place by an axle <b>222</b>. However, each tooth in the fork may be cut apart from its neighbors. A separation <b>224</b> between each of the teeth may allow for each tooth to flexibly move depending on the local topography of the lawn or garden surface under it. The segregated teeth may each be affixed at a hinge point <b>221</b> which may attach to the body <b>103</b> of the leaf caddy or to an exterior portion <b>220</b> of the fork <b>200</b>. When the hinges of the teeth are affixed to an exterior portion <b>220</b> of the fork <b>200</b>, this allows the angle of the fork to be adjustable as a whole for all teeth, where the separated teeth may have a degree of flexibility to move around that global angle. The hinge point <b>221</b> may include components such as spring or flaps that act like spring which may tend to force the teeth in a certain direction relative to the surface. In an example, springs may push the individual teeth down upon the surface, where the rolling ball <b>223</b> may maintain the tooth body at a certain height over the portion of the lawn surface directly under the teeth.</p>
        <p id="p-0042" num="0041">The various fork and teeth examples may have feature aspects that allow for facilitated replacement of subsections of the caddy structure. In some examples, an entire fork of teeth may be replaceable. The fork may slide into a slot on a body of the uplifted panel of the caddy. There may be attachment features such as various types of hardware including screws, rivets, snaps and the like to affix the fork to the panel. In other examples, the individual teeth may be replaceable. In a non-limiting example, in examples with hinges the hinge may be separable to allow for a facilitated replacement component aspect. In some examples, there may be sliding features underneath one or more teeth, which may be subjected to more wear than the teeth themselves. Accordingly, the ability to change individual teeth may allow for a replacement strategy for wear of the sliders located underneath teeth.</p>
        <heading id="h-0009" level="2">Height Adjustments</heading>
        <p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, item <b>300</b>, an exemplary height adjustment component is illustrated. The height and, in some examples, angle of the fork <b>200</b> in the front of the leaf caddy <b>100</b> may be adjusted by adjusting the center of a wheel to its attachment point on the body <b>103</b> of the leaf caddy <b>100</b>. In examples with wheels <b>301</b> directly fastened to the body <b>103</b> of the leaf caddy <b>100</b>, an adjustment level <b>302</b> may be moved to various locations <b>303</b> and in so moving may adjust the height of the wheel <b>301</b> relative to the body <b>103</b> of the leaf caddy. Numerous other designs for height adjustment such as but not limited to adjustment screws, and different attachment points for the wheels may also be employed.</p>
        <p id="p-0044" num="0043">The angle of the teeth of the fork <b>104</b> may be adjusted with added components as well. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, item <b>310</b>, an example of an adjustment component that may rotate the teeth of the fork <b>104</b> with respect to its attaching hinge <b>105</b> is illustrated. In an example, an affixed lever <b>311</b> may be rotated around the axis of the hinge <b>105</b> to hold the fork <b>104</b> at an adjusted angle. There may be numerous adjustment points <b>316</b> that the lever may be moved to and locked down to position the fork <b>104</b> into a desired angle relative to the body of the leaf caddy. There may be numerous other manners to adjust the angle of the fork <b>104</b> including in a non-limiting sense a locking screw on the end of the hinge axis.</p>
        <p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, item <b>320</b>, a leaf caddy <b>100</b> may be attached to a four wheeled structure. Thus, in addition to the two wheels, where one wheel <b>301</b> is illustrated in the side view, two additional wheels, where the location is shown with an additional wheel <b>321</b>, is also illustrated in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, may be attached to a structure <b>322</b>. Inside the structure <b>322</b> there may be components that allow for the wheels, <b>301</b> and <b>311</b> and their corresponding paired wheels to be adjusted relative to the structure <b>322</b> to which the leaf caddy body <b>103</b> may be attached. An adjustment component <b>325</b> may allow a movement of its dial to cause this relative movement of the center points of the wheels to the structure <b>322</b>. There may be numerous setpoints <b>326</b> which may set various height relationships of the forks to the surface of the yard or garden. Such height adjustments may be important for numerous aspects such as, in a non-limiting sense, the height of the grass in a yard, the nature of the debris, a particular design of a fork/teeth, a type of wheel attached to the structure and the like. In some examples, the adjustment component <b>325</b> may send an electrical signal that causes the components within the structure <b>322</b> to adjust the height by motorized means such as a motor rotating a screw attached to positioning elements of the height.</p>
        <heading id="h-0010" level="2">Powered Design Options</heading>
        <p id="p-0046" num="0045">A version of the leaf caddy may be created that may be affixed to a tractor, a riding lawn mower, an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or other powered conveyance. With all the different aspects that have been described including control over the angle of teeth protruding in the front of a pushing body, the leaf caddy may have powered aspects. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, item <b>410</b>, a leaf caddy <b>412</b>, which may be scaled to be larger than a manual design, may be attached to a tractor <b>411</b>. An attachment point <b>413</b> may hold the leaf caddy to the tractor. In some examples, the leaf caddy may include its own wheel as has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, item <b>410</b>. In other examples it may just be fixed to the body of the tractor <b>411</b>. The attachment point <b>413</b> may be a fixed plate in some examples. In other examples, the attachment point <b>413</b> may be more of a coupling allowing the leaf caddy to be placed onto the attachment point, such as with a set of hooks on one side overlapping a bar on the other side and having a locking fixture to hold it in place. In still further examples, the attachment point may include a flexing capability, with springs and shocks that may lock the leaf caddy in place but allow some movement to occur when the surface topography of the lawn or garden varies and puts stress onto the leaf caddy.</p>

        <heading id="h-0011" level="2">As a Supplement to Other Tools</heading>
        <p id="p-0053" num="0052">The various examples of a leaf caddy may be employed to assist a user in the performance of maintenance of yards and garden with debris upon them. The device may be used to push such debris into piles or to push the debris into a region where it may reside. The leaf caddy may be used in conjunction with other yard cleaning devices of a user. For example, a manually operated version of a leaf caddy may offer a time cutting solution for a user who is using a blower to create piles of leaves in a yard or garden.</p>
        <p id="p-0054" num="0053">For some leaf blowing units such as handheld, backpack or small rolled leaf blowers, piles of leaves may build up that are difficult to keep moving with a leaf blower. In such a case, the user with the blower may employ the leaf caddy to move the pile to a desired location and then resume operations with the leaf blower. Other such supplemental use of the leaf caddy with other tools may naturally be employed. An autonomous leaf caddy may be programmed to operate on a routine schedule where the schedule is designed to correspond with an amount of leaves or other debris that the leaf caddy may routinely deal with. Thus, after a leaf caddy performs such a routine schedule, a user may have an easier job to clean up a yard with a rake, leaf blower, vacuum or other yard cleaning tool as a supplement to the leaf caddy.</p>

        <heading id="h-0014" level="2">Methods Related to a Leaf Caddy</heading>
        <p id="p-0068" num="0067">Numerous methods may be executed during operation of a leaf caddy. In a first method, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a leaf caddy may be used to clean a lawn or garden surface of debris. At step <b>701</b>, a user may obtain a leaf caddy apparatus comprising at least a wheel or wheels, a frame that may collect debris as it is drawn into the leaf caddy, a handle to manually move the leaf caddy, and a fork with teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to aid in the collection of debris from the surface. Next at step <b>702</b>, a user may position the leaf caddy on a garden or lawn surface. At step <b>703</b>, an optional step may be performed to adjust the angle of the fork/teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to be optimized for the surface condition of the lawn surface. In other examples, the fork may be permanently angled on manufacture to be optimal for normal surface conditions. At step <b>704</b>, the user may push the leaf caddy across the surface, in so collecting debris into the frame. At step <b>705</b>, the user may move the leaf caddy to a region where the debris is desired to be moved to, or to a region where the user may remove the debris from the leaf caddy into a trash bag/receptacle/compost pile. At step <b>706</b>, the user may continue to back to step <b>704</b> until the surface cleaning is completed to a desired state.</p>
        <p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, an alternative method is depicted. At step <b>711</b>, a user may obtain a leaf caddy apparatus comprising at least a wheel or wheels, a frame that may collect debris as it is drawn into the leaf caddy, a handle to manually move the leaf caddy, and a fork with teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to aid in the collection of debris from the surface. Next at step <b>712</b>, a user may position the leaf caddy on a garden or lawn surface. At step <b>713</b>, an optional step may be performed to adjust the angle of the fork/teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to be optimized for the surface condition of the lawn surface. At step <b>714</b>, a user may employ one or more of a rake or a leaf blower or another implement to collect debris, particularly leaf debris, into piles. In some examples, the growth of the piles may make the collection process continually more difficult. At step <b>715</b>, a user may push a leaf caddy into the pile and move the pile to a desired location or collect some of the debris and then move it to another location. At step <b>716</b>, after reducing or eliminating the piles with the leaf caddy, a user may again employ one or more of a rake or a leaf blower to clean the surface. At step <b>717</b>, a user may optionally employ a vacuum to collect any small amount of debris remaining from the processing.</p>
        <p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, a user may employ power assist to move a leaf caddy. At step <b>720</b>, a user may obtain a leaf caddy apparatus comprising at least a wheel or wheels wherein the wheels are connected to a motorized movement assist apparatus, a frame that may collect debris as it is drawn into the leaf caddy, a handle to manually move the leaf caddy, and a fork with teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to aid in the collection of debris from the surface. At step <b>721</b>, the user may connect the leaf caddy to a power source, wherein the connection may either charge batteries within the leaf caddy or directly provide power through an electric cord. Or, in some examples, a fuel powered engine may provide one or more of electrical power to charge batteries or mechanical power to assist the wheels. Next at step <b>722</b>, a user may position the leaf caddy on a garden or lawn surface employing a lever or switch to engage the power drive as required. At step <b>723</b>, an optional step may be performed to adjust the angle of the fork/teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to be optimized for the surface condition of the lawn surface. At step <b>724</b>, a user may employ one or more of a rake or a leaf blower or another implement to collect debris, particularly leaf debris, into piles. In some examples, the growth of the piles may make the collection process continually more difficult. At step <b>725</b>, a user may move the leaf caddy into the pile and move the pile to a desired location or collect some of the debris and then move the leaf caddy to another location all employing a lever or switch to engage the power drive as required. At step <b>726</b>, after reducing or eliminating the piles with the leaf caddy, a user may again employ one or more of a rake or a leaf blower to clean the surface. At step <b>727</b>, a user may optionally employ a vacuum to collect any small amount of debris remaining from the processing. For examples where a leaf caddy is attached to a power system such as a mower unit, a user may get an advantage of pushing the debris away into piles or onto the periphery while at the same time mowing and cleaning any materials that remain after the leaf caddy apparatus passes over the yard or garden surface.</p>
        <p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, a user may employ an autonomous or semi-autonomous leaf caddy. At step <b>730</b>, a user may obtain a leaf caddy apparatus comprising at least a wheel or wheels wherein the wheels are connected to a motorized movement assist apparatus, a frame that may collect debris as it is drawn into the leaf caddy, a fork with teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to aid in the collection of debris from the surface, a navigation system to determine where the leaf caddy is and to sense perimeter signals to be aware of a regionally boundary over which the leaf caddy should not move, a computer to perform algorithmic tasks and plan a path of movement to collect debris and to place it in a desired location, and a communication element to allow the leaf caddy to receive controlling signals. At step <b>731</b>, the user may input via one or more of touch screen entry into the onboard computer or via wireless communication programs, datafiles, parameter setpoints and the like. At step <b>732</b> the user may connect the leaf caddy to a power source, wherein the connection may either charge batteries within the leaf caddy or directly provide power through an electric cord. Or, in some examples, a fuel powered engine may provide one or more of electrical power to charge batteries or mechanical power to assist the wheels. At step <b>733</b>, the user may optionally adjust the angle of the fork/teeth on the front of the leaf caddy to be optimized for the surface condition of the lawn or garden surface. At step <b>734</b>, a user may engage an autonomous mode wherein the leaf caddy may perform cleaning operations according to a schedule and a spatial cleaning plan which identifies regions of a lawn or garden to be cleaned. At step <b>735</b>, the user may optionally engage a manual control mode of the leaf caddy that may be controlled via a wireless transceiver such as on a game controller or with a smart phone or other device. At step <b>736</b>, the leaf caddy may return to a service dock where it may be secured, stored and recharged for power.</p>
