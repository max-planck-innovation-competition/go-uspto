<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims the benefit and priority of Chinese Patent Application No. 202110107591.2 filed on Jan. 27, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety as part of the present application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure belongs to the technical field of the electric heating film, and particularly relates to a self-regulating electric heating film and a preparation method and use thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, electric heating films have been widely used in many fields, such as heat preservation and heating for equipment or space, anti-icing and de-icing for surfaces of equipment such as an aircraft. The principle of electric heating of the film is based on Joule's law, which realizes electric heating by applying a certain voltage, and thus it is possible to change the &#x201c;solid-solid&#x201d; contact between an aircraft surface and ice into &#x201c;solid-liquid&#x201d; contact, thereby reducing the adhesion of the ice on the surface and achieving the anti-icing and de-icing effect. At present, electric heating films are mainly sprayed on the surface of an insulating substrate to form an integrated structural and functional part. Generally, the insulating substrate is a structural layer composed of glass fiber composite layer or polymer materials such as polyetheretherketone, and the sprayed electric heating film is a metal coating. When the film is electrified to be heated, if there is a covering locally, it is easy to cause local heat accumulation, resulting in an excessive temperature, which will damage the electric heating film, and even more seriously cause the covering to burn and cause a fire accident, thus failing to achieve the anti-icing and de-icing effect. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the electric heating film to realize a self-regulating heating, so as to achieve an excellent anti-icing and de-icing effect.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a self-regulating electric heating film and a preparation method and use thereof. The electric heating film provided by the present disclosure has a strong PTC effect, and could achieve anti-icing and de-icing effect by self-regulating electric heating when an appropriate voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To achieve the above object, the present disclosure provides the following technical solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a self-regulating electric heating film, comprising an insulating isolation layer; an interdigital electrode arranged on the surface of the insulating isolation layer; a positive temperature coefficient coating covering the surface of a secondary electrode of the interdigital electrode; and an insulating protective layer covering the surface of a primary electrode of the interdigital electrode; wherein the positive temperature coefficient coating is not in contact with the primary electrode of the interdigital electrode; and the insulating protective layer overlaps the positive temperature coefficient coating.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the positive temperature coefficient coating comprises the following components: 20-40 wt % of a nano conductive filler, 10-30 wt % of a positive temperature coefficient thermosensitive filler, 10-30 wt % of a polymer, and a balance of a phase-change material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the nano conductive filler includes at least one selected from the group consisting of graphene, conductive carbon black, carbon nanotube, nano graphite powder, a nano metal powder, and a nano metal wire.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the positive temperature coefficient thermosensitive filler includes at least one selected from the group consisting of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), a positive temperature coefficient ceramic powder, polycaprolactone, paraffin wax, and thermoplastic polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the phase-change material includes at least one selected from the group consisting of a low-temperature lubricating oil, a low-temperature grease, and paraffin wax.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, an overlap between the insulating protective layer and the positive temperature coefficient coating has a width of not less than 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the insulating protective layer covers both the primary electrode of the interdigital electrode and a part of the insulating isolation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the insulating isolation layer has a thickness of 10-30 &#x3bc;m; the positive temperature coefficient coating has a thickness of 30-90 &#x3bc;m; the insulating protective layer has a thickness of 10-30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure further provides a method for preparing the self-regulating electric heating film as described in the above technical solutions, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">preparing the insulating isolation layer, the positive temperature coefficient coating and the insulating protective layer independently by spraying.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure further provides use of the self-regulating electric heating film as described in the above technical solutions or the self-regulating electric heating film prepared by the method as described in the above technical solutions in the anti-icing and de-icing filed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a self-regulating electric heating film, comprising: an insulating isolation layer, an interdigital electrode arranged on the surface of the insulating isolation layer, a positive temperature coefficient coating covering the surface of a secondary electrode of the interdigital electrode, and an insulating protective layer covering the surface of a primary electrode of the interdigital electrode, wherein the positive temperature coefficient coating is not in contact with the primary electrode of the interdigital electrode, and the insulating protective layer overlaps the positive temperature coefficient coating. The electric heating film according to the present disclosure comprises an insulating isolation layer, an interdigital electrode arranged on the surface of the insulating isolation layer, a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) coating covering the surface of a secondary electrode of the interdigital electrode, and an insulating protective layer covering the surface of a primary electrode of the interdigital electrode, wherein the primary electrode of the interdigital electrode is not in contact with PTC coating, avoiding excessive high resistance of the primary electrode, which would adversely affect the transmission of electric energy; when an external voltage is applied thereto, an electric energy is transmitted to the secondary electrode through the primary electrode of the interdigital electrode, and then to the PTC coating by the secondary electrode; due to the PTC effect of the coating, after the coating is heated to a certain temperature, its resistance would increase, thereby decreasing the heating power, and having an automatic temperature regulating effect. Therefore, the electric heating film exhibits a self-regulating temperature performance, and thus could be used for anti-icing and de-icing. The results of the examples show that when the electric heating film according to the disclosed embodiments has a resistivity of 0.01 &#x3a9;&#xb7;m, it exhibits an intensity of PTC effect that reach above 25 times, and a good self-regulating temperature effect and droplet slip performance.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The self-regulating electric heating film was subjected to a performance test, and the results were shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 9</figref>, in which, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showed a plot of the resistance of the self-regulating electric heating film versus the temperature thereof, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> showed an infrared effect of the self-regulating electric heating film according to Example 2 from unheated to heated, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> showed a self-regulating effect of the self-regulating electric heating film according to Example 2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> showed a durability curve of the self-regulating electric heating film according to Example 2, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> showed a sliding effect of the self-regulating electric heating film according to Example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the electric heating film exhibits a great adjustability in resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> that, after being electrically heated, the temperature of the electric heating film gradually tends to uniform, indicating that the electric heating film according to this example could generate heat uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that with the increase of the electric heating time, the power of the electric heating film decreases rapidly first and then tends to decrease gradually, and finally remains unchanged, while the temperature thereof increases rapidly first and then tends to increase gradually, indicating that the electric heating film according to this example exhibits a self-regulating temperature performance.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each curve represents a different heating time, and it can be seen that after being heated for many times, the electric heating film still exhibits a stable PTC performance, indicating that the electric heating film according to the present disclosure exhibits an excellent durability.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that the ice layer on the surface of the electric heating film gradually melts and moves down over time, exhibits an obvious slip at 0.14 ms, and melts to form droplets at 0.27 ms, indicating that the electric heating film exhibits a good droplet sliding performance.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It can be seen from the above examples that the electric heating film according to the present disclosure exhibits a strong PTC effect, and could be used to achieve self-regulating anti-icing and de-icing when an appropriate voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The above is only preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, and it should be pointed out that for those of ordinary skill in the art, without departing from the principle of the present disclosure, several improvements and modifications could be made, and these improvements and modifications should also be regarded as falling within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p>
